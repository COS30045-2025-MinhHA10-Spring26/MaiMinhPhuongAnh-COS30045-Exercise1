# Exercise 0.2 – Energy Consumption Website

## Student Information
- Student Name: Mai Minh Phuong Anh
- Student ID: 104997232
- Unit: COS30045 – Data Visualisation
- Lecturer: Mr.Minh Hoang
- Institution: Swinburne University of Technology

## Purpose
This website was developed as part of Exercise 0.2 for COS30045. The purpose of this task is to demonstrate the development of a small interactive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the use of GitHub for version control and GitHub Pages for deployment.

The website will also serve as a base platform for hosting data visualisations required in later demonstrations.

## Website Overview
The website consists of three main pages:
- Home – Introduces household appliance energy consumption in the Australian context.
- Televisions – Presents placeholder content related to television energy usage and efficiency.
- About Us – Describes the purpose and educational context of the website.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript  
- Git & GitHub  
- GitHub Pages  

## Live Website (GitHub Pages)
The deployed website can be accessed at: https://cos30045-2025-minhha10-spring26.github.io/MaiMinhPhuongAnh-COS30045-Assignment/about.html

## Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) Declaration

### AI Tools and Technologies Used
The following Generative Artificial Intelligence tool was used during the completion of this assessment:

- ChatGPT (OpenAI) – a text-based generative assistant used for planning, explanation, example code generation, and drafting placeholder content.

No other generative AI tools or technologies were used.


### Detailed Record of AI Tool Usage

#### Prompt 1 – Project Planning and Requirement Interpretation
**Prompt used:  
“Create a step-by-step plan to build a small interactive website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, and GitHub Pages for a university assignment.”

**Purpose of the prompt:  
To assist with understanding the assessment requirements and planning a structured development workflow.

**Use of AI-generated output:  
The response was used as a planning reference only. The development steps were adapted and refined by the student. No content was copied directly into the submission.

#### Prompt 2 – JavaScript Navigation and Page State Detection
**Prompt used:  
“How can JavaScript be used to detect the current page and visually highlight the active navigation link?”

**Purpose of the prompt:  
To understand suitable JavaScript techniques for providing navigation feedback to users.

**Use of AI-generated output:  
Example logic was reviewed and modified to match the project’s structure and naming conventions. The final implementation was manually written and tested by the student.


#### Prompt 3 – Generation of Placeholder Content
**Prompt used:  
“Write placeholder content related to household appliance and television energy consumption in the Australian market.”

**Purpose of the prompt:  
To assist in generating relevant placeholder text required to populate the website pages.

**Use of AI-generated output:  
The generated content was reviewed, edited, and rewritten by the student to ensure clarity and relevance. The content is used strictly as placeholder material.

### Prompt 4 - Use of AI in README Structure and Documentation

**Prompt used:  
“How should a README.md file be structured for a university web development assignment, including an academic GenAI declaration?”

**Purpose of the prompt:  
This prompt was used to assist in determining an appropriate and academically acceptable structure for the README.md file, ensuring that required elements such as student information, project purpose, technical overview, deployment link, and GenAI disclosure were clearly organised.

**Use of AI-generated output: 
The AI-generated guidance was used as a reference for structuring the README.md file. Section headings and ordering were adapted by the student to align with the assessment requirements. All written content was reviewed, edited, and finalised by the student to ensure accuracy and academic integrity.

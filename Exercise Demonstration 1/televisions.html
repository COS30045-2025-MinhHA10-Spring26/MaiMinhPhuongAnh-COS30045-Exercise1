                    <p class="overview_description">
                        Televisions are among the most frequently used electrical appliances in Australian households.
                        With
                        many homes
                        operating multiple televisions daily, their combined energy consumption can contribute
                        significantly
                        to household
                        electricity usage.
                    </p>

                    <p class="overview_description">
                        Modern televisions are more energy-efficient than older models, but factors such as screen size,
                        display technology,
                        brightness settings, and usage duration still strongly influence total energy consumption.

                    <p>The most common television types currently found in Australia include:</p>

                    <div class="tv-type card">
                        <h3>LED / LCD Televisions</h3>
                        <p class="type_description">
                            LED and LCD televisions are widely used due to their affordability and relatively low energy
                            consumption.
                            Smaller screen sizes typically use less electricity, making them a popular choice for
                            bedrooms
                            and secondary
                            living areas.

                    <div class="tv-type card">
                        <h3>OLED Televisions</h3>
                        <p class="type_description">
                            OLED televisions offer superior picture quality but generally consume more power, especially
                            at
                            larger screen
                            sizes and higher brightness levels. Energy usage can increase significantly during extended
                            viewing periods.

                        <h3>Smart Televisions</h3>
                        <p class="type_description">
                            Smart TVs include built-in internet connectivity and streaming applications. While
                            convenient,
                            background
                            processes and standby modes may increase overall energy usage if not properly managed.

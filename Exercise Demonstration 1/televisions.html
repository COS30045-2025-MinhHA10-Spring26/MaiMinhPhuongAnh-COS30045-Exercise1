                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Televisions are among the most frequently used electrical appliances in Australian households. With
                    many homes
                    operating multiple televisions daily, their combined energy consumption can contribute significantly
                    to household
                    electricity usage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Modern televisions are more energy-efficient than older models, but factors such as screen size,
                    display technology,
                    brightness settings, and usage duration still strongly influence total energy consumption.
                </p>

            <section class="tv-types-section">
                <h2>Types of Televisions in Australian Homes</h2>
                <p>The most common television types currently found in Australia include:</p>

                <div class="tv-type">
                    <h3>LED / LCD Televisions</h3>
                    <p>
                        LED and LCD televisions are widely used due to their affordability and relatively low energy
                        consumption.
                        Smaller screen sizes typically use less electricity, making them a popular choice for bedrooms
                        and secondary
                        living areas.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="tv-type">
                    <h3>OLED Televisions</h3>
                    <p>
                        OLED televisions offer superior picture quality but generally consume more power, especially at
                        larger screen
                        sizes and higher brightness levels. Energy usage can increase significantly during extended
                        viewing periods.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="tv-type">
                    <h3>Smart Televisions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Smart TVs include built-in internet connectivity and streaming applications. While convenient,
                        background
                        processes and standby modes may increase overall energy usage if not properly managed.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="energy-consumption-section">
                <h2>Typical Energy Consumption (Indicative)</h2>
                <p>While exact electricity use varies by model, the following figures represent approximate average
                    consumption:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Small LED TV (40 - 43 inch): ~100 - 120 kWh per year</li>
                    <li>Large LED TV (55 - 65 inch): ~200 - 250 kWh per year</li>
                    <li>OLED TV (55 inch): ~250 - 300 kWh per year</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Actual energy usage depends on viewing habits, brightness settings, and hours of operation.</p>

            <section class="reduction-tips-section">
                <h2>Reducing Television Energy Use</h2>
                <p>Australian households can reduce television energy consumption by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Selecting energy-efficient models with high energy ratings</li>
                    <li>Reducing screen brightness where possible</li>
                    <li>Turning off TVs completely instead of leaving them on standby</li>
                    <li>Limiting unnecessary background app activity on smart TVs</li>
                </ul>

            <section class="future-section">
                <h2>Future Data Visualisation</h2>
                <p>
                    This page will later include interactive charts and visualisations to compare energy consumption
                    across television
                    types, sizes, and usage patterns.

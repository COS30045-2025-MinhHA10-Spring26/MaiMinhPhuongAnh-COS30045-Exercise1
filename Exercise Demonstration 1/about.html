                    This website was developed as part of an educational project focused on data visualisation and web
                    development.
                    Its purpose is to demonstrate how appliance energy consumption data can be presented clearly and
                    interactively
                    using modern web technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The content focuses on household electricity usage in Australia, using televisions as an example
                    appliance category.

                <h2>Understanding Appliance Energy Use in Australian Homes</h2>
                <p>
                    Electricity consumption in Australian households continues to rise as homes rely more heavily on
                    electronic appliances.
                    From entertainment systems to essential household devices, understanding how appliances consume
                    energy is an important
                    step toward reducing power bills and improving sustainability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website provides clear, accessible information about appliance energy consumption, with a focus
                    on commonly used
                    household devices such as televisions. It is designed to help users better understand where energy
                    is used and how
                    smarter choices can reduce environmental impact.

                <h2>Why Appliance Energy Consumption Matters</h2>
                <p>
                    Household appliances account for a significant portion of residential electricity use in Australia.
                    Even small
                    improvements in efficiency or changes in usage habits can lead to noticeable reductions in annual
                    energy costs.
                </p>
                <p>Key reasons to monitor appliance energy use include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lower electricity bills</li>
                    <li>Reduced carbon emissions</li>
                    <li>Improved appliance lifespan</li>
                    <li>Increased awareness of energy-efficient technologies</li>
                </ul>
